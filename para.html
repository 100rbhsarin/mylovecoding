            Taking responsibility - practicing 100 percent responsibility every day - is about 
            seeing ourselves not as right or wrong, but as an agent, 
            chooser, problem solver, and learner in the complex interrelationships 
            of our lives so that we can better integrate with the people 
            and world around us. When we do this,<br><br> we enjoy a better and more
             productive way to live and lead
